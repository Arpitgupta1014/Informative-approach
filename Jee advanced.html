    <h2><strong>How to Prepare for IIT JEE Advanced 2021&nbsp;- Tips &amp; Study Plan</strong></h2> 
     
    <p>Your stature in JEE Advanced Preparation rises when your approach towards the examination is solid, focused &amp; directional.</p> 
    <p>JEE is most sought-after engineering entrance exam &amp; Preparation for JEE Advanced can be incredibly hard when you’re missing some critical strategies needed to succeed.</p> 
    <p>Most of the Candidates are so engrossed in the preparation of JEE Mains Exam that they can’t see Advanced JEE coming until it hits the D-day.</p> 
    <p>To be honest, you can prepare for JEE Mains &amp; Advanced altogether. But these two-tier exams are held separately for a reason.</p> 
    <p>While the aim of JEE Main Exam is to ensure that the candidate has complete knowledge of the concept of 11th &amp; 12th PCM subjects, JEE Advanced is tougher. There is some difference in the syllabus of JEE Mains &amp; Advanced Exam.</p> 
    <p>We all know (and wish were not true sometimes), mastering an engineering entrance exam doesn’t happen overnight.</p> 
    <p>Here are five golden rules for success in JEE Advanced:</p> 
    <p><span class="fa fa-fw fa-hand-o-right"></span>JEE Advanced is an upgraded level of JEE Main. So, go ahead and dust off the <a href="https://scoop.eduncle.com/jee-advanced-preparation-books" target="_blank" title="Best Books for JEE Advanced"><strong><u>Best Books for JEE Advanced</u></strong></a>. Sign up for the JEE Advanced preparation lessons and achieve great score.</p> 
    <p><span class="fa fa-fw fa-hand-o-right"></span>Preparing your own notes is very important. Create notes after second or third reading of the chapter. When you have a collection of subject-wise notes all in one place. All in all, taking notes is a subtle, but powerful, way to make yourself more successful in learning &amp; memorizing.</p> 
    <p><span class="fa fa-fw fa-hand-o-right"></span>If you’re a visual thinker, try a mind map for preparing the notes. Start by writing the topic at the center of the page. From there, draw branches out to every key topic studied.</p> 
    <p><span class="fa fa-fw fa-hand-o-right"></span>Without regular practice, the slip from Master to Journeyman is too easy. Practicing same concepts &amp; topics again &amp; again might be painful, but it preserves &amp; build your preparation.</p> 
    <p><span class="fa fa-fw fa-hand-o-right"></span>Prepare for Exam as per the latest JEE Advanced 2020&nbsp;Pattern &amp; Syllabus.</p> 
    <p>Think about it!</p> 
    <p>You solve 20 questions daily &amp; you are content with your preparation level.</p> 
    <p>But, on the exam day, you’ll get two papers with 54 questions each.</p> 
    <p>And, you’ll have to solve the paper in 3 hours or less!</p> 
    <p>Get the Point!</p> 
    <p>If you set your preparation level optimal &amp; practice a mock test that matches the difficulty level of the exam, you won’t be sweaty &amp; anxious on the day of the Exam.</p> 
    <p>Better prepared than sorry...</p> 
    <p>That's' how you can be among the around 14% of peoples who crack JEE Advanced Exam.</p> 
    <h2><strong>JEE Advanced Question Papers</strong></h2> 
    <p>As we discussed in the previous section, you need to practice questions of a certain level.</p> 
    <p>Using basic concepts won’t make you a JEE Advanced Topper.</p> 
    <p>Switching from simple concepts to complex one will escalate your performance.</p> 
    <p>And, there is no better preparation aid than JEE Advanced Question Papers from Previous years.</p> 
    <p>Most of the experts &amp; experienced JEE faculties suggest taking up all the available last year papers.</p> 
    <p><strong>Here’s a bonus:</strong></p> 
    <p><span class="fa fa-fw fa-hand-o-right"></span>Download free PDF for <a href="https://scoop.eduncle.com/jee-advanced-answer-key" target="_blank" title="JEE Advanced Answer Keys"><strong><u>JEE Advanced Quoestion Papers</u></strong></a> so that you may practice previous year quoestions.</p>
